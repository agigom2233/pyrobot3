Pyrobot README File
----------------

It was successfully tested on Ubuntu 18.04. jonghyeon-yeo's enviroment

But it cannot be correctly worked on other enviroment.

There are some issue that works only on the ubuntu of the jonghyeon-yeo's computer who first ported it, but not on other environments.

We are checking the dependencies to see what are the causes of problem.

It seems even I execute with 'python3' command with pyrobot.py, imported files exected with python2 recursively.

This is the successful case step of jonghyeon-yeo's virtual enviroment.
